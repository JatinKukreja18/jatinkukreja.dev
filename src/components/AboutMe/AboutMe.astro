  <Card title="About Me">
    <p class="text-base lg:text-lg font-sans text-brand-blue">
      I'm a <strong class="font-bold">Frontend Developer</strong> with strong focus on the user experience. Having spent the last 9+ years working
      in MNCs, Product startups, a design studio and even as a full-time freelancer, I have gained a fair bit of experience in working on an
      array of projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      Fuelled by a passion for creating interactive and functional products, I strive to bridge the gap between Design, Product and Tech teams.
